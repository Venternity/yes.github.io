            <h2>Streamer's behavior</h2>
            <p> There are some obvious goals that streamers may wish to achieve like growth or income, but those goals need to remain separate from your reasons for streaming.  My definition of honesty in this situation is simple – to have fun.  I find it much easier to stick with streamers who clearly enjoy themselves and what they do.  Fun is contagious, and it will spread to those who are on your wavelength.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="c-col">
            <h2>Respect</h2>
            <p>This means having the flexibility to be able to work with a range of viewers and properly saying farewell to the ones who don’t want to work with you. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="c-col">
            <h2>Consistency</h2>
        <p> It’s difficult to stay interested in a stream when the start times are infrequent and spontaneous, if the streamer frequently starts content and moves on before completion, or if the streamer seems like a different person every stream.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="c-col">
        <h2>Chat environment</h2>
    <p>The type of chat environment that cumulates into a stream is ultimately dictated by the streamer and how he/she directs the chat.  In a way, I consider the chat environment to be a reflection of the streamer’s behavior.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="c-col">
    <h2>Stream Layout and Balance</h2>
<p>It is pleaseant to the viewer's eyes when they see a clean and visible layout. It is less distracting and it helps in focusing on the content being relayed.</p>
